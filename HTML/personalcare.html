        <p>Ultimately&sbquo; Smart Back&ndash;Packing aims to better your physical and mental health in the long term. However&sbquo; that is a goal that requires a great deal of time&sbquo; patience&sbquo; and effort on your part. To start&sbquo; consider dedicating a section of your backpack to &lsquo;Self&ndash;Care Essentials&rsquo;. &lsquo;Self&ndash;Care Essentials&rsquo; are items that help you care for yourself in and out of school.</p>
        <p>While the idea of &lsquo;Self&ndash;Care Essentials&rsquo; will vary from person to person&sbquo; I have compiled two key parts all students should include below&colon; a <a href="#healthpack">Health Pack</a> and <a href="#snackwater">snacks&sol;water</a>.</p>

                <p>Many students prioritize schoolwork unhealthily&sbquo; neglecting important aspects of physical health&sbquo; such as nutrition or exercise. However&sbquo; physical health is deeply intertwined with productivity and consequent in&ndash;school success. To obtain some daily nutrients while preparing yourself for emergencies&sbquo; keep a non&ndash;perishable snack as well as a water bottle in your backpack.</p>
