        <h1 class="large-header">Why Pack Efficient Stationery&quest;</h1>
        <p>Smart Back&ndash;Packing strives to make you feel prepared to work and feel your best. Thus&sbquo; having all the stationery utensils you need to succeed is crucial. Nevertheless&sbquo; according to an article written by Larissa Hirsch&sbquo; MD&sbquo; on Nemours Kids Health&sbquo; heavy backpacks correlate with head&sbquo; neck&sbquo; back&sbquo; and shoulder pains. Moreover&sbquo; they increase the risk of falling backward and sustaining related injuries&sbquo; such as bruising. For many students&sbquo; unnecessary stationery items&sbquo; such as bulky binders or large scissors&sbquo; add excessive weight to their backpacks. To solve this issue&sbquo; we must choose efficient stationery items that both take up less space and work effectively.</p>
        <p>Below&sbquo; I have compiled some of the best efficient alternatives to traditional stationery&sbquo; entirely based on personal experience: <a href="#gluetape">Glue Tape</a>&sbquo; <a href="#ministapler">Mini Stapler</a>&sbquo; <a href="#penscissors">Pen-like Scissors</a>&sbquo; <a href="#plasticeraser">Plastic Eraser</a>&sbquo; <a href="#mechpencil">Mechanical Pencil</a>&sbquo; <a href="#wordcards">Word Cards</a>&sbquo; <a href="#folders">Folders</a>&sbquo; and <a href="#refillablenotebooks">Refillable Notebooks</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="gluetape">Glue Tape</h3>
                <p>Glue Tape is a rolling adhesive that acts as a compact&sbquo; mess&ndash;free alternative to traditional Glue Sticks. Often&sbquo; Glue Sticks are bulky&sbquo; leaving a slimy residue and drying out easily. While Glue Tape comes in many shapes and sizes&sbquo; they are usually smaller than Glue Sticks&sbquo; freeing up room for other stationery items. Moreover&sbquo; the adhesive is similar to those in tape rolls&sbquo; lasting a long time. Additionally&sbquo; Glue Tape&rsquo;s roll&ndash;on structure prevents it from sticking to unwanted areas.</p>

                <p>As the name suggests&sbquo; Mini Staplers are the compact version of our most beloved office supply&colon; the Stapler. While the prevalence of their older sibling&sbquo; the Stapler&sbquo; may make Mini Staplers seem unnecessary&sbquo; having one on hand can be helpful in several instances. For example&sbquo; some teachers do not allow students to use classroom staplers for unrelated tasks&sbquo; such as putting notes together. Additionally&sbquo; a personal Mini Stapler can come in handy if the communal Stapler breaks down or runs out of staples.</p>

                <p>Pen&ndash;like Scissors are slender cutting tools enclosed with a capping mechanism. While traditional Scissors&sbquo; or even School Scissors&sbquo; are too big to fit in a pencil case&sbquo; Pen&ndash;like Scissors take up roughly the amount of space of a Crayola marker. Moreover&sbquo; as more schools shift schoolwork to online platforms&sbquo; scissors are less available for unexpected tasks like cutting a snagged thread. Additionally&sbquo; their capping mechanism make Pen&ndash;like Scissors safer to carry around than other cutting tools. </p>

                <p>Made from soft vinyl&sbquo; Plastic Erasers are among the most effective tools for erasing. We all know the feeling of spending what feels like hours frantically scratching poorly&ndash;performing Rubber Erasers across a test question before the teacher declares&sbquo; &lsquo;Pencils down.&rsquo;. Fortunately&sbquo; Plastic Erasers can thoroughly erase marks made by many different writing tools&sbquo; including pen ink. </p>

                <p>A Mechanical Pencil is a writing utensil releasing Lead pieces when a pushing force is applied to its mechanism. While traditional pencil Lead becomes flat with use&sbquo; Mechanical Pencil Lead remains the same thickness throughout. Moreover&sbquo; traditional Pencils bear the hassle of carrying bulky Pencil Sharpeners&sbquo; whereas Mechanical Pencil Lead refills come in slim packages. Additionally&sbquo; Mechanical Pencil Leads can be easily switched for many different colours&sbquo; pigments&sbquo; and more.</p>

                <p>Word Cards are flashcards joined together using a metal hoop. While traditional flashcards are needlessly large&sbquo; Word Cards are rather small&sbquo; designed for day&ndash;to&ndash;day use&sbquo; such as on the bus or in a hallway. Moreover&sbquo; traditional flashcards get lost easily&sbquo; whereas the hoop mechanism of Word Cards keeps them intact. Additionally&sbquo; you can easily refill or discard old flashcards in Word Cards by simply pushing the hoop apart.</p>

                <p>While many students rely on bulky binders to store loose papers&sbquo; folders serve the same purpose with a far lighter weight load. Moreover&sbquo; folders allow quick access to important papers&sbquo; whereas binders force you to unhook their metal rings. Additionally&sbquo; folders prevent the unwanted creasing that binders often inflict on paper. </p>

                <p>While most students use binders and notebooks separately&sbquo; Refillable Notebooks use an effortless pull&ndash;to&ndash;unlock mechanism to give you the best of both worlds. Often&sbquo; binders are needlessly bulky&sbquo; taking up most of the space in a backpack. In contrast&sbquo; you can easily control the weight of your Refillable Notebooks by adding or removing paper according to preference. Meanwhile&sbquo; wire&ndash;ring notebooks are incredibly wasteful as they have no purpose once their pages are filled. Refillable Notebooks are considerably more eco&ndash;friendly as you can stock them with organic paper and will only throw away used sheets.</p>
