        <h1 class="large-header">Why Choose the &lsquo;Right&rsquo; Backpack&quest;</h1>
        <p>Smart Back&ndash;Packing always begins with choosing the right backpack for you. But what determines the &lsquo;right&rsquo; backpack&sbquo; and how do you find it&quest; Well&sbquo; it can be a daunting task as backpacks are investments requiring careful consideration for factors like health&sbquo; effectiveness&sbquo; and efficiency. According to an article written by Larissa Hirsch&sbquo; MD&sbquo; on Nemours Kids Health&sbquo; backpacks play an influential role in your day&ndash;to&ndash;day health. Hirsch explains that heavy backpacks correlate with head&sbquo; neck&sbquo; back&sbquo; and shoulder pains while increasing the risk of falling backward. Additionally&sbquo; they may injure others in crowded spaces&sbquo; such as subways or school hallways. Meanwhile&sbquo; thin or tight backpack straps pose risks of arm and hand numbness. The article states that padded straps and weight&ndash;distributing frames are two mechanisms to combat these issues. Nevertheless&sbquo; we must also consider functionality when choosing a backpack through indicators such as durability or spaciousness to ensure a worthwhile investment. To maximize durability&sbquo; choose waterproof or water&ndash;resistant pieces made from tightly&ndash;packed fabrics. Meanwhile&sbquo; compare your personal belongings&sbquo; such as binders or notebooks&sbquo; to the size of a backpack to grasp space. For example&sbquo; The North Face Borealis backpack can easily fit a three&ndash;ring A4 binder&sbquo; while the Fj&auml;llr&auml;ven K&aring;nken Classic K&aring;nken cannot.</p>
        <p>To help assemble these components&sbquo; I created a rubric to judge any backpack from the perspective of a high&ndash;school student&excl; My rubric assesses four key categories&colon; durability&sbquo; space&sbquo; weight distribution&sbquo; and strap comfort. Below&sbquo; I compare three top contenders for the title of the &lsquo;right&rsquo; backpack based on facts&sbquo; personal experience&sbquo; and customer reviews&colon; <a href="#macaroon">Doughnut Macaroon</a>&sbquo; <a href="#kanken">Classic KÃ¥nken</a> and <a href="#borealis">Borealis</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="large-header">Top Three Picks</h1>
        <h2 id="macaroon">Doughnut Macaroon</h2>
        <p>Designed by Hong Kong&ndash;based brand Doughnut&sbquo; the &lsquo;Macaroon&rsquo; backpack is known for its durability&sbquo; spaciousness&sbquo; and bright style. The piece is crafted using &lsquo;Korea Heavy Twill Crinkle Finish&rsquo; fabric&sbquo; which is water&ndash;resistant and does not crease easily. Additionally&sbquo; it consists of genuine leather&ndash;trimmed buckles to ensure lasting. Moreover&sbquo; the backpack includes a main compartment&sbquo; a padded 14&rdquo; laptop section&sbquo; side pockets&sbquo; and a front pocket for immaculate organization. Nevertheless&sbquo; the piece&sbquo; which is similarly sized to the Classic K&aring;nken&sbquo; may lack space for people who carry many items. Overall&sbquo; this backpack is ideal for those with a medium weight&ndash;load&sbquo; wanting a long&ndash;lasting fashion piece to capture their individuality. The Macaroon recieves a final score of 19&sol;20 points.</p>

        <h2 id="kanken">Fj&auml;llr&auml;ven K&aring;nken Classic K&aring;nken</h2>
        <p>Designed by Swedish brand Fj&auml;llr&auml;ven K&aring;nken&sbquo; the &lsquo;Classic K&aring;nken&rsquo; backpack is loved globally for its durability&sbquo; ergonomic design&sbquo; and timeless style. Crafted using &lsquo;Vinylon F&rsquo;&sbquo; a fabric whose fibres grow closer together as it absorbs water&sbquo; the piece is highly waterproof. Moreover&sbquo; it utilizes Fj&auml;llr&auml;ven K&aring;nken&rsquo;s innovative square frame to distribute weight evenly across the back and shoulders&sbquo; unlike traditional pear frames. Nevertheless&sbquo; the backpack&rsquo;s single main compartment&sbquo; 13&quot; laptop section&sbquo; and tight side and front pockets are too small for those who prefer to carry large binders. Further&sbquo; while the straps are adjustable&sbquo; they are rather thin&sbquo; causing some shoulder pain during long periods of use. Overall&sbquo; this backpack will best serve those who have little to carry but seek a stylish&sbquo; long&ndash;lasting accessory to fit essentials. The Classic K&aring;nken recieves a final score of 17&sol;20 points.</p>

        <h2 id="borealis">The North Face Borealis</h2>
        <p>Designed by American brand The North Face&sbquo; the &lsquo;Borealis&rsquo; backpack is renowned for its spaciousness&sbquo; durability&sbquo; and comfort.
